st.title(" How the world was saved from the  :blue[Evil coding teacher] :sunglasses:")
st.write("It was an ordinary morning in Codeville when the unthinkable happened: Elena, a talented coder known for her clever solutions and quick thinking, vanished. For days, there was no sign of her. Her friends—Eiley, the problem-solving genius; Eugenia, the algorithm master; Tara, the web design prodigy; Yuna, the creative genius; and Alice, the data wizard—searched high and low, but their friend had disappeared without a trace.

Then, one evening, a mysterious message appeared on all their screens, written in cryptic code:

"If you wish to see Elena again, you must solve my riddles, defeat my traps, and prove you are worthy of her freedom. Welcome to my domain... The Lair of Eternal Code."

The message was from none other than the evil Professor Debug, the notorious coding teacher who had tormented students for years with his cruel challenges and sinister algorithms. Elena had been caught in his clutches, and now it was up to the Code Avengers to rescue her.

Chapter 2: The Journey Begins
The five students stood together at the edge of a dark, stormy forest. The air was thick with anticipation, and the sky above seemed to pulse with electrical energy as if the very clouds were made of code. The ground beneath their feet hummed with the sound of computer fans, and glowing lines of code danced in the distance, marking the entrance to Professor Debug’s lair.

"We don't have much time," Eiley said, clenching her fists. "We need to work together if we want to save Elena."

Eugenia nodded, her eyes narrowing in focus. "We’ll solve every challenge. We can't let Professor Debug win."

With resolve, they entered the lair.

Chapter 3: The Logic Gatekeeper
The entrance to Professor Debug’s lair was guarded by a massive Logic Gatekeeper, a towering, mechanical monster made entirely of tangled if-else statements and conditional loops. Its eyes were glowing red with binary code, and its massive claws were forged from faulty syntax.

"I can handle this," Eiley declared, stepping forward. She was known throughout Codeville for her extraordinary problem-solving skills.

The Logic Gatekeeper roared, its voice echoing with distorted code. "To pass, you must solve me! What is the truth? What is the condition?"

Eiley’s mind raced as she studied the logic puzzle before her. It was a nightmare of nested loops, unreachable code, and conflicting conditions. But Eiley was fearless. With a deep breath, she began typing rapidly, adjusting the logic, and eliminating unnecessary loops. Her fingers danced across the keyboard, weaving through the chaos of code.

Finally, with one final keystroke, the massive gatekeeper shut down with a deafening crash. The doors to the lair creaked open, revealing the next challenge.

Chapter 4: The Web of Traps
As the group walked deeper into the lair, the air grew colder. The walls were covered in glowing spider webs made of JavaScript, and the floor was a maze of broken links. The atmosphere was thick with the scent of bugs, and eerie whispers filled the air. Invisible code errors crawled along the walls, ready to spring traps that would freeze anyone who touched them.

“This is a web I can’t get through,” muttered Tara. "But I know how to stop it."

With a determined look in her eyes, Tara pulled out her laptop. She opened a fresh web page and began typing rapidly. Responsive design, she thought. Preventing broken links. Shielding from invisible errors. She coded a protection layer—a firewall of her own, made from clean and efficient HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

As the walls began to close in on them, Tara’s design shield shimmered brightly, blocking the deadly traps. The Code Avengers followed her lead, moving through the web of chaos without triggering a single alarm. They were one step closer to Elena.

Chapter 5: The Algorithmic Maze
The deeper they ventured into the lair, the more treacherous the challenges became. They entered a vast, echoing chamber—the Algorithmic Maze. Thousands of endless loops and if-else branches spiraled around them, creating a labyrinth that seemed impossible to navigate. At the center of the maze stood Elena, trapped inside a glowing cage of infinite recursion.

“Help me!” Elena’s voice echoed, distorted by the swirling code.

“We’re here, Elena!” Eugenia shouted. “Don’t worry. We’re going to fix this.”

Eugenia stepped forward, her eyes alight with determination. The maze of code was a nightmare of tangled conditions and infinite loops, but Eugenia had the perfect solution. She began to dissect the problem, isolating the layers of code with lightning-fast precision.

"This is all about optimization," Eugenia muttered to herself, her fingers flying across the keys. She wrote a divide-and-conquer algorithm, splitting the maze into smaller, solvable parts, using binary search to find the shortest path.

The loops began to collapse as Eugenia’s logic broke the maze apart. With one final sweep of her hand, the code disintegrated, and Elena’s cage shattered.

Chapter 6: The Creative Code Conundrum
Just as they thought they were free, another obstacle appeared. This time, it was Professor Debug himself, standing at the far end of the chamber, a wicked grin spreading across his face. “You may have solved my puzzles, but now you must face my final creation!”

Suddenly, the walls turned into a massive screen, flickering with chaotic patterns and disjointed colors. It was an artistic nightmare—a coding riddle that required a blend of imagination and technical skill to solve. Elena’s face was locked in a state of confusion, unable to focus on the task before her.

Yuna stepped forward, a smile creeping across her face. "This is my kind of challenge."

Yuna’s mind was a treasure trove of creative solutions. She understood the art of coding like few others. With grace and elegance, she wrote a recursive function that rearranged the chaotic mess of code, turning it into a beautiful, flowing pattern. She blended logic with creativity, transforming the wild, unstructured mess into a stunning design.

As the screen cleared, Elena was freed. The lair’s walls began to crumble.

Chapter 7: The Final Showdown
Professor Debug stepped forward, his hands glowing with malicious energy. “You think you can defeat me? I am the master of all code! No one has ever escaped my domain!”

He raised his hands, and the entire lair trembled. A massive bugged-out firewall appeared before them, blocking their way. The air crackled with error messages, and the code around them began to spiral into chaos.

But Alice, the data wizard, wasn’t afraid. “I’ve got this,” she said, opening her laptop and typing furiously. She analyzed the firewall's structure and quickly realized it was built on an unstable data structure—one that could be bypassed.

“I’ll restructure the code,” Alice said. With a wave of her hands, she rewrote the firewall’s data into a hash map, making it stable but flexible. Then, using efficient sorting algorithms, she sorted the errors, clearing the path ahead.

As the firewall shattered, the Professor let out an unearthly scream. “Nooo!” he shouted as the code turned against him, trapping him in a never-ending loop of his own creation.

Epilogue: Victory and Beyond
The Code Avengers had saved the day. Elena, free at last, rushed to hug her friends. “I knew you’d come,” she said, smiling through tears of joy.

The team embraced, knowing their combined strengths had been the key to overcoming every obstacle. They’d defeated the evil Professor Debug and proven that friendship, teamwork, and coding brilliance could conquer even the darkest of challenges.

From that day on, Eiley, Eugenia, Tara, Yuna, Alice, and Elena became legends, inspiring all of Codeville with their courage and coding skills. Their names were whispered in every classroom, and their story was told to every aspiring coder.

And so, the Code Avengers coded happily ever after.
